This repo contains source code & resource files in a tree structure (yyp keeps scripts flat which sucks, so I have to ) which are synced with YYP project using [gm-cli](https://github.com/Alkapivo/gm-cli). As a result I dont have to use GameMaker IDE or GMEdit, I can just use visual studio code :) 

See [visu-project](https://github.com/Alkapivo/visu-project) repo in order to learn more about the project.
